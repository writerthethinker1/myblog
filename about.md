Hi, my name is Ramneek Narayan and I'm the owner of the Hibiscus Caf√© (the hibiscus plant is very special). In this blog you will find new and perhaps interesting ideas related to the fields of mathematics, logic, and statistics. You might even find some pages posted just for fun without any intention of being mathematical; they are there for your enjoyment. Each post is a thought and each thought was brewed inside of the mind, and by reading these articles you are drinking thoughts, leting them digest inside of you. You become changed by their flavour and chemical properties. Hence, each post is a drink, served nice and warm. I await your next visit with gusto!
