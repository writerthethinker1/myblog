Hi, my name is Ramneek Narayan and I'm the owner of the Hibiscus Caf√© (the hibiscus plant is very special). In this blog you will find new and perhaps interesting ideas related to the fields of mathematics, logic, statistics, and rationality. You might even find some pages posted just for fun without any intention of being mathematical; they are there for your enjoyment. Each post is a thought and each thought was brewed inside of the mind. By reading these articles you in turn are drinking thoughts, letting them digest inside of your mind. You become changed by their flavour and chemical properties (way they were written). Hence, each post is a drink, served nice and warm. If you are not satisfied with any order (post), feel free to contact me via email or any of the other social media platforms above. I await your next visit with gusto!
