This post continues ideas given for sign theory. We will talk about how to compute reciprocals of signed numbers such as $2^\ast + 1^-$ and develop more notions behind the geometry that is going on. We will create a new type of modulus that is similar to that in Euclidean geometry that plays a key role in creating reciprocals. After this, we will show the end result of how to take square roots and outline a proof of such using linear algebra.
