My name is Ramneek Narayan and I'm the owner of this café. In this blog you will find new and perhaps interesting ideas related to the fields of mathematics, logic, statistics, and rationality. You might even find some pages posted just for fun without any intention of being mathematical; they are there for your enjoyment. Each post is a thought and each thought was brewed inside of the mind. By reading these articles you in turn are drinking thoughts, letting them digest inside of your mind as you do with anyone else's. You become changed by their flavor and chemical properties (way they were written). Hence, each post is a drink, served nice and warm (or cold if you like iced teas/coffee). If you are not satisfied or have questions about any order (post), feel free to contact me via email or any of the other social media platforms given. I await your next visit with gusto and enjoy preparing new drinks!

**About the café title:** I love to eat chocolate and salted cashews together. Together they make a *Cocoa-nut*. I named the café after this concept.
