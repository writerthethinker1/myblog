*"Life doesn't get any better after mental illness."* - Pysch Ward Nurse

This note is rather personal, so don't be offended if you don't always agree with what is written. It is a small reflection of what the writer experienced and hopes to dispel some myths about mental illness and 'creative leaps.' The writer will tell you now: **what leads to creative leaps is brain efficiency brought out by genes and good nutrition, nothing else.** Now on with the story...

By Spring 2018 the writer had the first of several experiences with auditory hallucinations ('hearing voices') and delusions. It was during this time anti-psychotics were sadly taken since they had harmful health effects like weight gain and constipation (ate lots of spinach and prune juice during Spring 2018!). Rather than give you some 'sob story' about what happened, the writer will tell you the effects of what psychosis did on his life so that you can learn from him and (hopefully) be grateful that you don't have the same condition (only 1% of the world's population has it; while there are many people in the world, this is a small number in comparison). Here's the gist: **life become worse and harder than before, much harder; hearing voices made concentration difficult and I couldn't even make my class schedule during the beginning of Spring 2018 since each second I kept hearing voices say terrible things.** So, here's plainly what happened after psychosis:

### Truth about voices...

- Courses became **harder** (not easier)
- Lost/lose money buying meds and going to Er/Psych Ward (~$500)
- Couldn’t fall asleep normally/Couldn’t get any sleep
- Had to drop courses
- Couldn’t relax
- Couldn’t think without interruption
- Wanted to die (you would too, most people at least feel like it)
- Lost opportunities that I would have had with no voices
- Had more headaches (lots more)
- Lost time going to psychiatry, while everyone else did whatever
- Couldn’t do things everyone else does (couldn't relate well with others)
- Gained 30lbs. while on meds

And here's plainly answers to what it's like hearing 'voices':

### Voice FAQ

- How loud are the voices?
    - They can be as loud as actual people talking. This confuses me sometimes as I don’t know who said what. After meds, the voices became quieter in volume but still I felt disassociated.
- Do they ever help you?
    - No. No voice ever in my life has ever helped me. They say mean things and are very critical of what I think. They are like bullies or taunting people. They make me want to die.
- Do they go beyond what you know?
    - Never. My life has been bad since I heard voices and these things relate to my experiences.


What life became after psychosis was hollow, the writer lost all desire and enjoyment for anything in this life. The medication was sedating and interfered with waking up on time and also led to really bad constipation and hard stools **everyday**. On top of this was courses typical for everyone; that's when things were terrible: the writer lost all free time ironically. There was 0% time for anything else now between going to psychiatry and dealing with voices every single day. Things felt hopeless, it was as if effort was of no use now, that things became worse without reason. Those were the hardest days of life, but more were to follow as this was a first of 3 cases of psychosis. All had similar symptoms and each time more meds were taken, begrudgingly. After some time, the writer accepted that this was life and things were sad, very sad indeed. But, anyhow, what does this mean to you? It means that if you are free of mental illness, then there is plenty to be grateful for. You have good chance to improve your life without mental blocks like the writer. The writer was once normal and can see what this is like and would be glad to have it again. Because here is what it is like for the writer:

1. Wake up, shake off tiredness from the meds.
2. Go about day (hear many things).
3. Time to end day, take 3 meds and go to sleep.
4. Start it all over again, for the rest of your life. (this was hard to swallow, it was very discouraging to know)

If the meds run out, or if you forget them; then you are in for BIG TROUBLE, especially if the voices are getting louder. In short, without the Lithium and Prozac you will feel a rush of sadness for no reason and without the Zyprexa you will want to hang yourself. It's always a good idea to keep a count of how much time you have left before the next refill and schedule accordingly. Not that the writer advocates death, but when one becomes sick like this forever, it isn't a big deal as it is for most people. The writer looks forward to dying since it means an end to all of this; finally it's over :). It is like the coin is flipped now and the other side of life is seen much more clearly and illusion is taken away in place of reality.

All remarks aside, this is what mental illness can do, its effects are negative. Be glad you don't have to think about and deal with these things; it makes the little problems in life seem even more tiny and not worth one's passion. A psychosis rewires the mind as it adjusts to new challenges; life will become more difficult and one has to adapt to it. Worst of all, this was done by the basis of genes and now the rest of life is degraded in quality. One also feels alienated from others as they can't relate to them anymore. Acceptance is rather difficult and it is the last lesson to learn. Hope things work out! That's it for life after psychosis. The writer can't wait till death! The writer hopes it's swift and painless, nothing comes after it! He means this in the most soothing way possible.
