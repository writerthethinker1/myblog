Some steps to easy meditation the writer promotes. There are many types of meditation depending on what one wishes to train their mind to. Shared here are 3 ways the writer collected in the past.

**Where to meditate:** best done in quiet place, safe place, distraction free place, and place deprived of the senses (dark rooms or night-time).

**How long to meditate:** as long as one wishes, more time gives better results though. One can begin in 5 minute intervals and work up from there. Might be a good idea to have set times of the day to meditate if very busy in life.

**Position:** Either sitting on ground (cross-legged with straight back) or sitting on chair (straight posture). Posture is important for the breathing.

Types of Meditation[^1]

1. **Vipassana (Mindfulness)**
    * Focus on breathing only and be mindful of all other thoughts (don’t care about them, note them, don’t focus on them, don’t give them any thought: *so it is, so it isn’t, don’t care*)
    * The gains: Empathy, self-awareness, focus, directing attention
2. **Trancendental Meditation (TM)**
    * Focus on one mantra and keep saying it inside the mind, focus really hard on it, see what the words mean and keep that concept strong for the duration of the mediation. Perhaps to start: *rid of all bonds*.
    * The gains: Advanced cognitive function, attention focus, more sensory experience
3. **Lovingkindness Meditation (Tibet)**
    * Focus on doing kind deeds to other people even when they may have hurt you in the past. Focus on just one deed each meditation and really conceptualize it and make that kind feeling of receiving and giving love from and to someone else strong. Make the meditation fully thought out to be effective.
    * The gains: Positive emotions, self-control, sense of oneness with world, more accurate perception of reality, bliss, better memories, **gamma waves**
