These are some statistics about the world and life in general. Given here to give a more realistic view of what humans do and how they use their lives. The general trend is to have more humans around. It seems humans give rise to more humans at an alarming rate. Some of us are born normal and lead normal lives as intended, but others will have deformities that hurt their life satisfaction and desire to live. People neglect these people who have problems, thinking they are lower and they are superior. No one thinks when they make more humans and only those born with deficiencies live the reality that comes with it. **I despise it is this way, that others can have a moment of enjoyment and have their offspring feel the effects for the rest of their lives.** But, that is how it is and nothing can be done about the reality that is lived. Those who view life as enjoyable and fear death are ignorant and above all, weak. Those people are faulty in mind and are inferior in that sense. They are fooled by what life offers. They don't see it in its totality.

These are just some important statistics for the writer. There are others and are updated on a real time basis based on computer algorithms. They count the number of abortions, cigarettes smoked, days until usable oil is gone, and the number of suicides this year to name a few.
