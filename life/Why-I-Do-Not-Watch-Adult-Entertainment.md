# Why I Do Not Watch Adult Entertainment <i class="fas fa-kiss-wink-heart"></i>

I have had a long battle with adult entertainment ever since I could access it. By itself, it is nothing terrible minus the objectification and rather crude treatment of women and men (mostly women). Also, there is evidence to support that non-regular viewing can be harmless[^2][^3]. However, once I started noticing changes to my daily lifestyle that I'd rather not have (missing sleep, difficulty finding priorities, impulsiveness, etc...), I decided for myself to put an end to it since it wasn't a moderate activity for me. I found that going off the stuff can be rather difficult as it goes against the reward mechanism rooted deep in our minds since ancestral times. But, as soon as I looked into the neuroscience of what actually goes on inside my mind when I view adult images, I turned my head to it. Each time I went to those kinds of images/videos/gifs, I wasn't making any progress in improving my or anyone else's life and I wasn't happy when I was 'finished' watching for the night; **I kept having the same 'I will not this again' feeling (which is good, by the way) that sadly subsided when the time to stop really counted. From there I was back to square one, as with most men/women.** What helps me today is the neuroscience behind addicting adult content; **we are effectively rewiring our neurons when we see adult content much like when people are addicted to drugs like cocaine.** This note gives my final reasons for not giving in to adult entertainment. First we go into what makes sexual content so amazing to the brain:

## Brain in 'Love'

When the brain is in 'love' (sexually) with another person, hormones and neurotransmitters coordinate a response to drive libido, create need, and enhance the likelihood of bonding. More formally, the stages of love can be written as[^1]

1. Lust **(Testosterone/Estrogen)**
2. Attraction **(Dopamine, Noradrenaline, Low Serotonin)**
3. Attachment **(Oxytocin, Vasopressin)**

In lust, the brain relies on testosterone and estrogen to drive a sexual response towards another person. Men will start having sexual desires for whomever they are sexually attracted to and the same goes for women. This is primal and is unconsciously driven by our ancestors need to reproduce to keep the species alive[^1]. If the feels are allowed to continue, what follows next is attraction, wherein dopamine and noradrenaline increase in the brain when we spend time with those we are sexually attracted to and engage in sexual activities. *The reward pathway of the brain is now active towards this person.*[^1] People in this stage of attraction, if the attraction is high, can become very active or excited that they lose need for food and rest[^1]. Coupled with a **decrease in serotonin**, people in attraction can become obsessed over the other person by neglecting basic needs[^1]. We make an important note that **lust and attraction shut off the brains prefrontal cortex, inhibiting rational decision making (one can then make choices they later regret or don't understand in the future)**[^1]. When the relationship is promoted, then oxytocin and vasopressin are released in the brain (especially during sex) which makes the people closer together. **Be warned, though, high levels of dopamine and oxytocin can lead to addictive/irrational behaviors, adultery, and jealously.**[^1]

What this section shows is that sexual response is something carefully made by the brain and doesn't spontaneously happen; it relies on hormones and neurotransmitters. In the next section, we show how adult entertainment can take advantage of this primitive response of the brain.

## Brain when viewing 'Adult Content'

Most effects of viewing adult entertainment on the brain are **negative**. In fact, sexual arousal (as also noted above) interferes with one's frontal lobes and leads to a loss of working memory[^4]. This then leads to a chain of events (if one is addicted or truly immersed in viewing) where one can be 'forgetful' in other parts of life such as sleep, job interviews, job timeliness, work performance, and relationship issues (sexual or otherwise)[^4]. Not only is the brain's prefrontal cortex effectively 'inhibited' or under attack as one losses working memory, but this region can actually work less effectively at controlling impulses and setting needs for basic tasks (such as good hygiene) as pornography is viewed more often in frequent intervals[^6]. Hyper-sexuality encouraged by frequent porn viewing also take advantage of the brain's *reward pathway* ('meso-limbic reward centers'[^5]) wherein videos or other erotic content can have a lasting impact on how the brain sees pleasure, thereby leading to an addiction or the feeling that one 'needs' the content when in reality it is more a want[^5]. Notice, this is the same reward pathway that is also used when one is in a sexual relationship with another person. This suggests that porn has a similar effect to the brain as with any other sexual activity (an addiction is the same to the brain, either with porn or another person). In a sense, porn uses this same circuitry (reward pathway) as when we have sexual contact with someone; the brain isn't creative when it comes to sex. The same response happens each time in either case. Pornography encourages hyper-sexuality which damages one's own brain if used in the long term, in frequent intervals.

## The Conclusion

The net effect of high porn use is a higher use of the brain's reward centers which then lead to a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable (such as sports, hobbies, etc...)[^4] as videos give a greater reward and provide instant satisfaction and are (for the most part) free and easy to find. The prefrontal cortex is also abused in the process and higher order executive processes are weakened which can alter its biochemistry (preference for 'drug-associated stimuli' and lack of interest in self-maintenance)[^5]. **Watching adult content always gives a short-term high and then leaves one where there were before the videos and in a position to view again in the future.** One does not become more intelligent nor a better person from watching porn. While some who are not frequent viewers claim no effect on sexuality[^3], regular use of porn can change the brain's structure towards lower high executive function, effectively lowering one's quality of life. $\blacksquare$
