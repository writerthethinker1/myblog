<h1 style="margin-top:0.5em">Life Count <i class="fas fa-sliders-h"></i></h1>

This note is a place to record the amount of things that happen in the writer's life mindfully so as to see how the mind is reflected and which ways to change its direction. Its aim is to keep the writer motivated in counting things in life so as not to go off course and become lazy. The construction of wholesome states (habits) of mind and weakening of unwholesome states (habits) of mind essentially. At the end there is a dated reflection on what things have been observed. Times recorded are since the idea was first thought of, so no particular start date, just the idea.

<ul style="color:#FE9A2E">
<li>Times Meditated (> 5min.): 8</li>
<li>Days Liquid Food (> 1 meal): 16</li>
<li>Days Exercised: 47</li>
<li>Days Early Rise (< 9:00AM): 1</li>
<li>Days Cold Shower: 65/100</li>
</ul>

**Reflection:** Starting to increase liquid food again, noticing same amount of fullness but am not as tired as with old meals. Also noticed shivering less in showers than Nov. 2019, saving time and money but still just as hygienic. Worst part is the first 30sec. but then it is okay. Want to increase meditation time.
