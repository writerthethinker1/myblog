<h1 style="margin-top:0.5em">Life Count <i class="fas fa-sliders-h"></i></h1>
This note is a place to record the amount of things that happen in the writer's life mindfully so as to see how the mind is reflected and which ways to change its direction. Its aim is to keep the writer motivated in counting things in life so as not to go off course and become unfocused. The construction of wholesome states (habits) of mind and weakening of unwholesome states (habits) of mind essentially. At the end there is a dated reflection on what things have been observed. Times recorded are since the idea was first thought of, so no particular start date, just the idea.

<li>Days Exercised: 54/100 <i class="fas fa-running"></i></li>

<li>Days Restless (hard to fall asleep): 31 <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i></li>
</ul>

**Reflection:** Continuing with the cold showers, it is helping to train mindset to withstand setbacks and keep trying toward a better future. Haven't been meditating but am more likely if go to bed early and make time for it as well as remind myself of the benefits for the mind (it aids the State of Calm). Still feeling restless as going to sleep and reflecting on the past as well as decisions made in life, nothing but regret. Want to stop this cycle as it can hurt the future, so am taking more melatonin (7.5mg) to make sleep easier. This week as been rough, for some reason I am just sad and want to sleep more. The part of me that held on to life is broken and now I am trying to live with that part gone. Real life will be harder than what I am going through now, so it is best I prepare for those days. By no means is living enjoyable now and if I try to communicate this to anyone, they just don't understand. Looks like I'm going solo for this quest to earn a good future. Best of luck for those days as well as to you, reader, perhaps you feel/have felt similar.
