This post serves as an introduction to the theory of signs. Given here...

* Numbers with 3 signs
* Rule for multiplication
* Rule for addition
* Interpolated signs theorem

While one can construct systems with many signs, we will primarily focus on those with 3 signs. Just as in regular arithmetic we have two signs $+$ and $-$, so in this theory we have three signs namely $+$, $-$, and $*$. We will use the special notation of affixing signs as superscripts for the numbers they are with. So, for example, if we wanted to symbolize 'negative one', then we would write $1^-$ instead of the usual $-1$ in ordinary arithmetic.

**Example 1:** Write the 3 signs of $1$

*Solution:* This would be plus one, minus one, and star one or $1^+$, $1^-$, and $1^*$ respectively. $\blacksquare$
