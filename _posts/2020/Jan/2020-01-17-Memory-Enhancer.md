Given here are tools the writer found help with developing a memory that can be used to aid in learning or life. The writer uses these implicitly to retain information and has (since 2018) mapped out those methods. They are now shared with the reader for similar effects. Those marked with stars are used heavily for recall by the writer, but the reader may have their own preferences.

1. **Picture Data Compression***

    In this method we take a picture that represents a concept or some memory and keep it in mind whenever it comes up again. For example, if one is concerned with finding the formula of a curve rotated about an axis, one could remember a picture used to derive the formula and piece together what the formula is from that picture. In statistics, the p-value is an area, so when the concept of a p-value comes up again, a curve with a tail shaded comes up in the mind, this makes recall easier.

    * **Tip:** *Use colors over text for memory* = memory booster (use this frequently, map numbers to colors, mind sees it better).

    * **Example:** Replace “heads or tails” with colors “white and black”, can remember better (like Go pebbles).

2. **Sketch idea until fully detailed**

    Get a big general nonspecific (as easy as can be) idea of a concept, then slowly add more details to the idea until the whole idea is understood (like sketching a picture). Effective for complex intricate concepts that have multiple simultaneous parts. The method is to break down complex pieces of information into digestible parts, easy to understand tiny ideas than all of them working at once.

    **Process:** Easy as can be idea (so easy its obvious and can be recalled w/o too much effort, captures beginning of concept in plain english, could be purpose of idea) → Add detail \#1 (trouble shoot if confusing) → Add detail \#2 (connect with previous detail) → Keep adding details (check if lost) → summarize whole idea → Concept understood!

3. **Consistent Practice: Repetition, Repetition, Repetition**

    Test your recall over previously learned ideas by the next morning or the end of day (or whatever time works best for you). If you seem foggy on certain parts, then revise them again. This strengthens previously learned connections, making it more likely that you will remember it better. The mind works on the principle 'use it or lose it' and the writer has noticed this with things learned over the course of life; those things that are not recalled daily are soon to be forgotten as the mind tries to be more efficient with its storage. *It takes a consistent effort to remember information well into the future where they will come in handy.*

      * **Tip:** Set reminders to recall information; make it a routine until it is automatic, like adding numbers. Flashcards help, especially [Anki](https://www.ankiapp.com/), it gives automatic scoring and tests where you are the weakest.

4. **Connect concepts, find relations between them**

    Sometimes one idea is a different form of another idea or there is some commonality between ideas. When this occurs, you can note or search for common features between unrelated ideas, then strengthen this connection. This allows you to ‘bundle’ ideas together catching them with a net and thereby assisting with recall. Even obvious or simple connections help. Physicist Richard Feynman called this *triangulation of ideas* in his book *Tips on Physics*.

      * **Example:** Suppose I am stuck on the idea of a median for statistics. Then a curve is plotted and the median is seen (from a physical point of view) as a place where the mass of the solid is equally distributed. The idea in statistics is now related to an idea in physics and this can aid in recall. Same with the mean: it is a balance point for the mass (distribution curve). Moments of distributions as well, they are like physical moments for masses; they have the same form for calculation.

5. **Try to enjoy (or take interest) in what is learned**

    Concepts are easier to recall when you are ‘provoked’ (positive sense) by them. They seem to stay in the mind better because they **affect you directly.** If a subject isn’t too enjoyable, then try to find an alternative reason for studying the subject (securing a livelihood, benefiting others, &etc...). If it’s still not enjoyable, then make analogies with the subject, particularly with something you know you enjoy. This may help make the information more ‘provocative.’

    * **Realization:** Usually people who are excellent in their fields like what it is they are doing; it is not a chore to them. What this means is that not liking something gets in the way of neatly acquiring new information; somehow this needs to be resolved for one to learn better.

6. **Rephrase concepts in your own words***

    By putting the author’s words in your own, you can more easily see how the ideas connect as the words you use are better defined (to you) and connect with how the specific abstractions you made. You will remember them better as a result. People use words differently in different contexts, all you can do is interpret them, it is your interpretation that is known to you. By using your own words, you become closer to that interpretation and see the ideas clearly than had you used the author’s words (which most likely made sense to them). Everyone has their own interpretation, make the subject of its own variety in the mind. If you really have the time the writer recommends the *[Feynman Method](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)* for learning.  

      * **Questions to guide:**
        * What does this idea mean (own words)?
        * Another way of saying X is what?
        * We use this concept because why?
        * By X the author meant what?

7. **Draw Pictures/Diagrams***


    Pictures can be misleading on their own, this is true: many can manipulate a diagram to suit their *needs*. However, pictures are one way to approach a subject without having to strain oneself trying to capture one aspect of the truth the author speaks of. They help guide what is called ‘intuition’ (big picture ideas) which may be ‘wrong’ in the sense that there are contradictions between what the picture references and what actually happened, but they help one traverse their thoughts efficiently and can even guide one through the thick forest of thoughts, allowing them to make something useful. One way to complement a digram is with a *valid deductive argument* (if one thinks this is needed).

      * **When this was used:** understanding Simpson’s paradox by equations (ratios) or pictures (vectors), both are valid but one is easier to grasp at first and so will be used primarily to remember concept (both are correct however, pictures are faster and require less processing, at least it seems).

      * Here's why[^1]: suppose we say $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{a'}{b'} < \frac{c}{d} < \frac{c'}{d'}$. Then from this we can deduce $\frac{a + c}{b + d} > \frac{a' + c'}{b' + d'}$ paradoxically. This makes little sense algebraically, but let's say we have $\vec{v}_1 = (a, b)^T$, $\vec{v}_1' = (a', b')^T$, $\vec{v}_2 = (c, d)^T$, and $\vec{v}_2' = (c', d')^T$ and we plot them on a grid with the same slope relations given. Then geometrically we observe that $\text{slope}(\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2) > \text{slope}(\vec{v}_1' + \vec{v}_2')$ without unintuitive symbol manipulation.
