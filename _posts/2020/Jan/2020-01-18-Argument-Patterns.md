*“‘I don’t know what you mean’ is an excuse. Ask the arguer what they mean instead, how they arrived at their deduction or induction.”*

There are **systematic ways** to evaluate the validity of arguments. Use these to see if an argument has flaws and can be improved. These techniques can evaluate any lingering thoughts. Let's get to it!


1. **Generalization**

    Try to generalize (abstract) the argument to see if he conclusion applies to all possible cases. Arguments usually are specific to whatever the person is talking about and rarely generalize to many cases.

    * **Example:** *Rainy days are always cold.* This argument can be broken by considering rain in tropical areas where it is warm such as Hawaii. We generalized the location and found a *counter-example* (important).

2. **Semantic Meaning of ‘words’**

    Try rearranging or substituting the ‘important’ (not logical operators) words in a sentence and see how the meaning of the argument changes. People do not ‘prove’ anything meaningful, they are *crunching tautologies and these tautologies have no meaning on their own.* Pay more attention to an argument's form rather than its content for evaluation; it saves one time rather than getting tangled in controversial issues such as morality or ethics. *An argument isn't worth your time if it isn't logically valid. Ask the arguer for their inference rules. They might be using a different logic than you.*

    * **Example:** replace “God” with “biscuit” in any argument proving God and see how your interpretation changes. Words are meaningless, they are interconnected concepts that make no sense on their own. *And this proves that biscuits exist by the nature of biscuitness. For biscuits are beyond inference. Thanks to biscuits we are made.* The form is the same yet the validity is questionable still.

3. **Fuse Definitions**

    If an argument has many definitions that seem mutually exclusive to each other, try to see if both definitions can be true at the same time.

    * **Example:** There are things that are prime and things that are even, but nothing can be such that it is prime and even. If you fuse both definitions together, you end up with a true result: there are primes that are even (2 is the number), so this argument is not always true and the way we found out was by questioning the mutual exclusiveness of the definitions.

4. **Assumptions when making conclusions** (how words are defined to the person and other relations between ideas)

    Some arguments are valid and lead to a correct conclusion, but others are sound. These arguments have something about them I can’t yet point out but something about their assumptions is ‘undeniable’ to the person making them. Sometimes one’s assumptions may not be correct or even ‘deniable’ to others, in these cases the conclusions one makes may not be sound to all. Whenever you hear a statement or conclusion made by someone that you don’t agree with, ask them their views or assumptions, then try to see the argument from their point of view first before discussing your own. People usually assume many things when making bold statements without explaining them.

    * **Example:** *Life is beautiful and full of joy.* This person (though kind-hearted) is ignorant of the lesser looked at aspects of life such as constant hunt for and by predators as well as the probabilistic nature of gene inheritance which can potentially make some less adaptable to their environment, leading to a harder existence. Their implicit assumption was that everyone is granted the same liberties upon birth, when by counterexample ( e.g. mentally and physically ill) it is clearly not the case. By knowning these assumptions the person's deduction can be seen as valid if their implicit premise was true; it is not, and hence the deduction is invalid. However, we learn more that the deduction was not 'out of thin air' but brought about by false assumptions.

5. **Check for Fallacies**[^1]

    Sometimes people reason but their reasoning leads to contradictions where both true and false are known with definite certainty. These are *fallacies*, and all fallacies can be broken by demonstration of valid *counter-examples* (this is how we know they are fallacious). A good example of this is a logically fallacy known as affirming the consequent where we (mistakenly) infer the antecedent from the consequent just because the consequent was found to be true. In reality, there could have been many reasons for the consequent to be true and no reason to conclude that a certain antecedent is the true at the same time the consequent is true (could other reasons for the consequent to be true at the same time?).

    * **Aside:** It is this type of reasoning that makes a scientist make a placebo group, otherwise they might conclude their drug was actually effective when it was not.

      **Example:** Consider the argument: If this drug works, then the person’s pain will be reduced. The person’s pain was reduced. Therefore, this drug works. (*Did you make a placebo or at least a control group, do you know if anything else in tandem or apart from your drug relieved the pain?*). Try this reasoning (if you know no interaction): (the drug works XOR anything else) → (pain reduced), then try to disprove the anything else, the drug works falls into your lap! If there is interaction, then our work becomes harder, the goal of ruling out an interaction is to show that the “anything else” is negligible in comparison to the drug itself (we admit there could have been an interaction, but it’s not strong enough for consideration). Here’s one way you could reason: (drug works XOR interaction with anything else XOR anything else with no interaction) → (pain reduced). Somehow you will have to isolate that “anything else” apart from using the drug only whatever your best guess is for that “anything.”

This is the end of the first post about argument patterns, the writer hopes to find more in an effort to aid reasoning processes and effectively assess people's arguments. In the process we can see what things are worth argument (time) and what things are useless to think about. There are limitations to human logic in a broader sense; certain things can be said with validity and others can never be assessed. Anyways, goodnight (or morning or afternoon depending on where you are) and see you in the next writing! <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i>
