Google and Windows waste resources and production workers time and health making defective products:

- lower quality
- same parts (chips made of same materials)
- better os software is already coded and fully operational on 'lower' devices or 'cheaper models'

as far as cost is concerned, we can make one high quality product and be eco friendly and save production worker's time and health knowing that they made a good product that the consumer will enjoy.

- not seeing talent in all developers
- not caring about making high quality goods, those are reserved for higher paying consumers

if you agree to their ideas, you buy from them. but...know that they

why? it's simple: they invest **time** and **money** on defective products and jeopardize worker's health in making goods consumers do not like in comparison to models that are made of same parts.

**a dose of production rationality.**
