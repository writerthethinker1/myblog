In studying the sars-cov-2 pandemic, there were some interesting facts learned about wet markets and their cultural role for humanity particularly asian cuisine...

Here's a list of some items sold at wet markets[^1]:

* camel
* civet cat
* donkey
* kangaroo
* pig
* wolf pups
* dog
* cat
* sheep
* fox
* pangolin
* alligator
* turtle
* snake
* salamander
* swan
* peacock
* wild goose
* ostrich
* porcupine
* rabbit
* bamboo rat
* musk rat
* marmot
* squirrel
* otter
* Barking Deer
* Roe Deer
* Sika Deer
* bee pupa
* silkworm
* centipede
* grasshopper

- notice:
	some items originate in consumption due to **lack of available food**[^1], similar to canibalism here in US during winter time in colonial periods[^2]...better animals than humans. then again, no data on Asian eating habits regarding canibalism (kill former friend for the purpose of nutritive value solely because there is no food available and primality is taken. Suddenly life is more important than bonds with others, the thinking goes...). by 2019: no famine as in 1960-70: so...we can see that...

	food is eaten for...

	* economic value (cheap): some too poor to buy quality meat and quality animals...
	* taste: some enjoy taste of famine food...
	* cultural beliefs (medicine, eg): some try to heal using ancient medicinal beliefs of people who once lived there...
	* other reasons not listed here, but still prominent among consumers: others see it as a social norm to consume, **much like chickens here in US**, little question it, at all.


  #### note on sanitation procedures...

	currently...

	* no major gov't laws or mandates enforced for clean animals and most citizens do not care so long as they have their own lives met nicely with fortune. plus, most citizens of virus, as well as in other countries too, are passive in absorbing information from credible sources; rather work, live, be ignorant and then...be surprised when life hits them. they tend to develop a notion of 'country' of 'politics' of all values than seek to divide others and prohibit the truth of universality. it seems peace and calmness are averted for their way of life. however, the city of Shenzhen has banned the sale of dog and cat meat as of April 2020.[^3]

> clearly variety is plenty and this wouldn't be too terrible if quality standards are met. but with so many animals? could a gov't really do that, make sure standards for each different type of species? no. they can't do that. so, obviously the animals aren't known to have viruses or diseases prior to being sold to the consumer. animals are caught in mass and subjected to mistreatment, like chickens here in US, flithy cages and poor hygiene and ways to keep healthy before butchering and preparing to consumers. not only this...but the animals are then given to eateries where others prepare, fry, and serve these creatures to tourists, rich men/women, children, poor men/women, and it has become a strong part of asian culture.

based on this...

> it is no surprise any toxin or virus could emerge. it is plain obvious since no central gov't action was taken to maintain citizen's health.

therefore:

> china's gov't doesn't place the health of its own citizens high. the gov't devalues citizen health, so then, the citizen is seen as parts of a machine, can get another easily. those in power are corrupt because it is within their hands to do so, make measures for it's citizens toward a so-called 'common-wealth' but...look at 2020: the origin of the virus, the cause of economic hardship and global actions taken by major world powers and medical investment into a vaccine is: CHINA's gov't.

this means...

> due to china's gov't actions...

* major world countries **average citizens** (wealthy CEOs contrarily found a surplus of profit and certain major retailers have witnessed no change in commerce since the beginning of 2020[^4]) lost:

	* money -- vaccine cost's and distribution; lack of income from reported 'loss of revenue'
	* time -- vaccine's time for research and media distribution of news
	* loved ones -- obvious deaths
	* friends -- obvious deaths
	* jobs -- obvious layoffs
	* mental energy (time to thinking about pandemic) -- lack of entertainment as before, loss of past hobbies, and general new adjustment to 'pandemic life'; even old things are different with a mask on...

In addition...

> China's gov't is the **point of origin**. not only that, but the country's gov't is stingy in sharing developments it took toward (reportedly) having citizen's be 'cured' from virus and have the state it's in by October 2020, even the genetic code was stingily given and makes were charged for as those sold to Italy when large corpses of Italian bodies emerged: family members, loved ones, and so on...even then...we didn't even know what type of mask was most effective, just that some were sold, they could have done little or had no effect and scientists are weak at disclosing the true nature of the masks we wear in terms of effectiveness and if they do know, popular media is rather stingy as reporting credibly.

> china is a poor country, in my opinion. maybe economically not so, but in terms of ethics? no. not there. if any economic hardship is faced by anyone during this time, do not blame other gov'ts, address the source, china's. The gov't devalues their own citizens who are silenced there (lack of speech and requirement of outside sources from country to spread news) and some people who have symptoms of the virus are refused treatment:

> ∴ again, the gov't of china doesn't place a citizen as valuable.

Please, be kind to yourself during this time: I am and most of the cascading events that resulted are from a poor gov't, by people you have no control nor influence over. None of this was within your hands.

The gift of truth excels all other gifts...
