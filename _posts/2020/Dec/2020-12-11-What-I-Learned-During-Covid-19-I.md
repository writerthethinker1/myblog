- tibet is cleaner than mainland china
- chinese leaders fly away like birds when things are though
- china has had only 90,000 cases of corona! but they still want 100% of the population to be vaccinated
- china filters their news heavily to bias toward nationalism even though political leaders are enforced strict lockdowns in wuhan and economic disaster happened to numerous wuhan citizens
- chinese leaders like making tibetans undergo military style labour
- china is not communist because of chinese billionaires
- russia is not communist because of russian billionaires
- joe biden is having memory deficits, his running mate is excited to be vice president
- trump was sick with corona, fauci was sick with corona, the white house was sick with corona
- fauci is trying to have everyone vaccinated before political leaders and major ceos, nor does he publicly endorse those leaders to vaccinate as well
- vaccine trials were done at 'warp speed' meaning they were rushed and scientific data is misleading
- corona is showing various mutations in different countries
- people really like toilet paper : i <3 toliet paper
- people of NK worship the dictator, since birth, like...it is a ritual
- major world countries have developed atomic weapons, and that those weapons all cost money
- major tech ceos are moving to texas, adios!
- most gov't funds are going to slowly stop starting...dec. 26, post holiday shopping, at least in US
- certain types of vaccines are present within certain countries, nor are countries sharing methods to make vaccines should they feel them extraordinarily efficacious.
- the world is becoming more totalitarian with increased technology
- people are quick to dismiss major political and ceo actions, they would rather bicker and argue within their own classes rather than rise above themselves and see what the elites are doing
- it is insanely difficult to manage expenses when your bussiness is gone from pandemic, nor are you doing anything joyous
- people are critical of those mentally ill and define their own notions of existence, they deem themselves superior and seek to maximize their own gain without having empathy

these are just the things i learned during this corona outbreak from wet markets in wuhan. by the political actions of leaders in china as well as other nations around the world, what i have ultimately learned is that the average citizen is worthless. meaning, there is a hierarchy of importance where political leaders and ceos stand on top and all others must passively be at the bottom.
