## Just opinion and remarks

i predict the vaccine will have some nervous implications. i sincerely hope i'm wrong and it goes as planned and we have that utopia feeling again where we over-pollute the earth and make fuss over useless things.

1. if the vaccine does fail, then everyone will be affected, jobs gone, homes lost, and perhaps more inflation. that much is true. that includes the world ceos, politicians, and lawmakers who live in their own world.
2. if the vaccines partially fail, then select people who might be injected first will suffer the consequences. by make lawmaker plans, i doubt a large scale disaster will happen, but what i do suspect is lower minorities being guniea pigs.
3. if vaccines work, we resume life to a somewhat normal degree.

> remember: vaccination is SLOW, it will take time and prioritizing 'most affected' allows them to see how well it really works. watch, it fails the minorities and they recall all those vials. or maybe some time passes and the effects are there, at this point, we don't know. 70% immune? maybe summer, slowly, summer at best, maybe even december. but...what's the rush? especially when we don't know and major world leaders fail to take the vials by their own hands? why are people in pfizer not taking shots before others right now? if it's gold, then take it, we have 1M+ doses?
