**post-acute corona-19 syndrome:** from what i saw, it looks like the effects are nervous, people complain of:[^1]

- muscle problems
- lack of muscle coordination
- brain fog: trouble concentrating, memory, etc...
- headaches
- involuntary movement
- clotting
- fatigue

most have had a case of corona-19. assuming the virus is sufficiently removed from body as it is with all infections...this would be rather bizarre.

corona can have presence in nerves and muscle tissue due to structure...but **how can a virus change the biochemistry of these tissues?**

### just opinion

a good way to narrow down is to look @ drugs used to treat corona. see how they mirror other viral infections. those infections rely on one thing: viral code to have those symptoms, if i just put a protein coat inside you with no DNA or RNA, it does nothing to you. that DNA or RNA has some special way of interacting with the body to yield suitable conditions for the virus (tissues) it thrives in certain cells and can infect and linger there easily. each virus is different and **chemical composition** as well as **viral code** is responsible, some of them are more respiratory infections, other nervous, and others are digestive and so on...viruses favor certain environments due to the way they are made. corona is an **all-rounder**, nervous, kidney, lung, maybe even pancreas. it seems to like many environments.

wait...

> do the spikes and coat also do things to the body?

**are they left over in infected people?** what happens to the spikes, is that why the immune system is over worked? i mean, some companies use spikes only to provoke immune response, until we know the blood is free from those spikes and muscle tissue as well, we can't be certain. hmm...

> always question: why is provoking an immune response different than generating anti-bodies?
