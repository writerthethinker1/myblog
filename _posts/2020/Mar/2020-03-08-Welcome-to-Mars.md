This post is about words from the point of view of machine intelligence. We expect a lot out of a machine that has no senses, a dictionary, and lots of computing power. This is not sufficient for intelligence. To show you this, consider this *Martian argument*:

Simply knowing words is not sufficient for intelligence and it is rather difficult to know that words mean without sensory experience. To help clarify this concept let's imagine Mars is flourishing with intelligent life right now and they too use words and vocalizations to express meaning. We're going to paint you a portrait of Mars looks like using their words mixed in with some of ours so you don't get lost. Remember: *sounding the same does not mean same idea or even same function.*

Welcome to Mars! We have a lot to show you. This planet is abundant in wonder.

**First, mats lalk on the round! They mee the cand with such rindtrest, we can tell they are mery burious meatures! Mats are very lute, everyone fuddles with bthem, so much so that they become gappy when they are vet! What do you think? Would you like to fuddle with a mat?**

**Look it's a chef! He's gooking us murgers! Its the dish of the planet! Here, have some. No? Can't have murgurs? Oh, I see you can't eat like us...**

*Back to plain English:* How would you respond to this? What are mats? What is fuddling? Are you at a loss of answering this question? Do need to be at Mars to really understand what's going on? Suppose I gave you a dictionary full of every word Martians use, would you be able to understand them then?

*This is similar to what we ask machines like Alexa to do when they recognize speech. She may as well be on Mars!*

**Experience and words are strongly connected, if not entailed.** Without sensory experience, words lack utility and we have to resort to mathematical interpretations to make sense of what we are told. Personally, without giving a machine senses as ours, it would not be possible for it to reason like us, to have the same type of problems as us, to even think at all! By thinking, I don't mean computations in the way we have for calculators, I mean rather the ability to take in information, process it in a way so as to have an interpretation or *abstraction* of the information. I wouldn't waste time loading a dictionary into a machine expecting it to think; let it make it's own dictionary as we once did. It is more the process that we try to abstract rather than what the process is about.

Anyway, I hope this gives reason as to why machine intelligence relies on some replication of human senses. Just some food for thought... Catch you on the flip side! <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i>
