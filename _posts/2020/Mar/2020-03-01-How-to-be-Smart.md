This note just lists ideas I found about being smart. What was the most important thing that I learned was that **being smart takes effort**, if all of the talented people we know today did nothing, then they would not be smart. No one is born smart, in fact all of us when we were babies were not the brightest (some babies eat feces and contract polio, they don't even know poop is bad for them...).

- Always question the material, ask many questions. There is no such thing as a ‘bad’ question.

  - Before one learns, there are implicit questions behind the learning. Make many of them as possible so it becomes a positive habit.

  ---

- Read many books, this helps you acquire more information

  - More information means a greater ability to create new information and improve one's crystalized intelligence as well as fluid intelligence.

  ---

- Go into detail with what you learn

  - Try to see if you fully understand a concept and sometimes see how the meaning changes if the assumptions are not valid.

  ---

- Raise your awareness, this shows how much your mind knows

  - Try a meditative activity such as organizing items or memorizing lists to clear out the mind. You could also just try plain meditation too. Too much stimulation keeps one from realizing themselves independent of others and societal norms (i.e. what is conditioned for us to believe)

  ---

- Have a wide variety of interests, this helps you connect information from seemingly unrelated fields.

  - Don't force this one, but the brain as an affinity for making novel connections between many subjects. Take von Neumann, for example.

  ---

- Work very hard towards your goals, it takes hard work to learn new information and meaningfully apply the information

  - Let's try to build a sand castle without doing anything at all. Let's try to make lunch without buying any ingredients and just sit on the couch instead. Do you think it can be built? Do you think the lunch we want to eat can be made while we are on the couch? Of course not. Anything we make takes dedicated time and continual effort to make, if we stop out efforts, then likewise that thing we dreamed of making is also gone.

- Experiment with knowledge and don’t be afraid of failure, spring back up from you failures. *The true failure in failing is failing to keep going in spite of that failure.*

  - A world without uncertainty is not this world. No one knows the true outcomes of their efforts because there is some amount of doubt by the way this place is made. Ask: do you even know everything that's going to happen tomorrow? Imagine that for 365 days and the uncertainty multiplies. Uncertainty is a part of this world. In the same way, pursuing any activity might not always work, that is inevitable; there was a chance it would not work out. Suppose I make a new dish, can I know if I will like it for sure? Of course not. *I won't know until I try.*

  ---

- Be focused, focus helps learn new information and aids in creative endeavors

  - Imagine listening to someone talk but thinking of something else. Is it possible to understand what they are saying then? This is what unfocus is, doing one thing but thinking of something else. By narrowing one's mental energies toward one task one makes the most advancements in it.

- Have fun with the material, this may help with memories

  - This is a memory enhancer. Remember the last time you did something fun? Joke with friends? Play a video game? Do you remember how easy it is to recall those moments? The brain works the same way when one enjoys what they learn.

This ends the post on how to be smart. The most important lesson is that 'smartness' is like making a muscle in the brain and this muscle can shrink when one is lazy and grow when one is disciplined. **Every advancement society has came from people who could think.** If we didn't think as we do, then we have no way to improve our lives. Our experiences wouldn't be as detailed and we would be slaves to our own minds design. See you next post! <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i>
