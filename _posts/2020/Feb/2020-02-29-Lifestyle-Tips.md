Note: These are some tips that I will try to follow to live a higher quality of life with more productivity. Let’s begin.

1. **Wash dishes as soon as you finish eating your food (100% of the time)**

    - This prevents more dishes from piling up in the sink from other people that you may have to wash later. It also lowers the amount of dishes that you have to wash at a time, making dish washing faster and less taxing.

2. **Time tasks to get a sense of your routine**

    - Try to write down your routine for the morning, afternoon, or evening (anything you want timed), then, with a stopwatch, time the tasks for your routine to see how long the completion time is. Reflect on the time you observed and the time you would like to achieve for the tasks or overall routine, questioning which tasks are the most important to keep and developing ways to shorten completion times (e.g. waking early, using colder water, etc…).

3. **Time tasks that you find difficult to convince yourself to do but will benefit you**

    - This for things such as chores around the house (like vacuuming), hygiene tasks (such as replacing toothbrushes or emptying the trash), and organizational activities (making the bed or removing old papers, for example). Surprisingly, most of the ‘chores’ that are a pain to start and finish take less time than you would expect.

4. **Eat a nutritious diet and avoid fried and ‘junk’ food**

    - Try to include a variety of greens and other wholesome fruits and vegetables into your diet. Also, cut the consumption of meat and dairy replacing them with beans, lentils, nuts, and plant milks like almond or soy milk. Absolutely no eating of fried food as these foods are known to cause sluggishness and contribute little to your health. Eating foods that contain gluten such as bread or regular pasta is OK but you can avoid gluten if you want to, just note that you will feel the need to eat more frequently.  

5. **Set your bed everyday, even if you think it will take a lot of time**

    - A set bed looks neater and makes it easier to go to bed at night. It also helps you fight off the morning laziness that comes from waking up early.

6. **Sleep and wake at a regular times each day**

    - This is discussed as a productivity tip on the [Methods for Tasks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020/Feb/2020-02-29-Methods-for-Tasks.md %}) section; see it for more details.

7. **Think and plan for the future but don’t attribute future expectations or emotions to events yet to happen**

    - It’s wise to plan and anticipate your actions for future events but torture to your brain when expectations or anticipated feelings of excitement and joy take over the body. See future events only for what they are and adopt a habit of not speculating further about them, envisioning further later events that may not even happen. Very scarcely will events in life ‘work out’ as you had planned and even more scarily will all of your expectations and needs be met. If you do not think unwittingly beyond the event (likened with dreaming) then you find yourself not disappointed when your exceptions are not met and sometimes grateful for what really happened. When this occurs have a resilient flexible attitude accustomed to reason that can work with what actually happened, allowing you to move forward easier. Oddly enough, when you practice thinking of the future in this fashion, you become more active in the present by rationally approaching future decisions and not worrying or fantasizing about the event as you once had—simply admitting not knowing about the future puts you more in the present where action is really needed.

8. **Know that one day nearly everything living will die, including humans**

    - Doing this allows you to reflect on the fragility of life and common fate we all must face: death. Even more importantly, most of us will have to face the death of people who are the most closest to us and endure the loss. Realizing this is a step towards reality for it might alert you to live your moments while living and breathing with respect for all life focusing on the positive events that happen rather than the negative ones, allowing death to render them minuscule in the grand scheme of things. Note that this is not a reason to take life less seriously rather an opportunity to not become overwhelmed by it, letting you better interact in it. After all, the same outcome awaits you as others in the past regardless of previous associations.

9. **Eat a light dinner or skip dinner entirely**

    - This is helpful to the body as it does not have to digest anything during the late hours. Unless your work involves strenuous activity, you most likely do not need the extra calories as your body needs less calories to keep you alive and organs healthy.

Hope these tips helped, will see you later! <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i>
