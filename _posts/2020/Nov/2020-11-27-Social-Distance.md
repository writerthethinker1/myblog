a day in social distancing...

wake up! time to brush teeth and clean up face, pee, and get ready for the day (it's my day off). it's almost time for thanksgiving and i'm looking forward to turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, and pumpkin pie. i went out and bought all those while taking care to not spread any of the new virus using those pollution masks which **aren't proven to stop the spread of corona virus.** i have a whole 50 pack just for my various errands and i use a fresh one each day at work (i work for the town hall).

i already planned it ^^, when it's time to eat the dinner, i'm going to first make sure my mask is on, i carry the table outside, i light the candles outside since it's going to be dark, i dress the table with my plates, make sure everyone gets to pick what their favorites are. then, i'm going to sit down with everyone and make sure they all have their masks on before we start to eat. i have 2 tables since we have kids, they need to social distance themselves right now because they might have corona and be carriers, who knows? i could be a carrier too. i'm just following orders. i even separated the tables **5 feet apart** just to be safe this holiday season. i even know how i'm going to eat, first i take a spoon of the mashed potatoes, then i gently take off my mask with my other hand from the bottom, then i take a bite, and just so i don't spread covid while i do this i hold my breath. once the pollution mask is back on my face, i start to chew and take breaths, then once i am done chewing, i swallow the food and do this until my meal is over. you know is this pandemic time, it's best to be safe than sorry. what if the house gets it? i always have to argue with average citizens about this when they disagree with me, but we leaders know that safety first is the best practice, it's just a pollution mask that has **not been proven effective for over 7 months** since corona was prominent around the world (my boss tells me we need more than 2 years for any breakthrough data on how mask wearing can reduce spread of covid).

enough thinking of the future, thanksgiving will come sooner than i expect, time to enjoy today! i'm going to the park with my friends, maybe we'll have a good time. first, i'm going to put my mask on (you know i always tell the family that masks are all too important right now, so they must always leave the house with one) and start walking outside until i reach the park and meet up with them. while i walk, i have to be sure to not be too near to others, at least 5 feet during this pandemic time, so if i see someone and they walk near me in the opposite direction, i'm going to move 5 feet to the left before they come too close (i could have contracted corona then, you know). at cross walks with at least one other person, i'm going to stand 5 feet apart from everyone, and maybe if there's a lot of people, we'll make a line and safely mitigate the spread of the virus. it doesn't matter, we'll cross one at a time (it saves us the fear of being uncomfortably close to each other during the pandemic, like neck to neck).

okay i'm finally at the park after a very slow and careful walk. it's time for a good conversation with my friends phil and bill.

"yo phil! how's it going? how are you managing work? (phil's a federal representative)"

"not bad, the walk took awhile with all this social distancing, i took a meter stick with me just to be sure i don't get sick and i fully support joe biden's new future measures for keeping us safe. i had a close one with this one guy while at a cross walk. can you believe it? he wanted to cross before me in this whole 5 feet apart line we had, we had a huge argument over who was there first. turns out i was there first, but by then, my time for crossing was up and i had to wait again! but anyways, work's okay right now and i think with all the numerous vaccines out there, one's gotta work, you know; we don't need the fancy numbers and figures, we'll just go with the flow. at least, that's what my boss tells me."

"good to know you practice social distancing like me! don't worry about those close calls, i had multiple too. can you believe it? **this guy touched me!** i had to **hand sanitize my whole arm!** i wasn't paying too much attention while walking and we accidentally bumped into each other. i immediately had this sense that there might be an exposure to covid, so i instinctively jumped for my pocket spray hand sanitizer that's **not proven effective at all** and sprayed this whole arm, all of it. then, i asked the man if he wanted his arm sprayed to in the name of being careful, but he was gone by then. oh well."

*bill comes.*

"yo! bill! glad you were able to be here!"

"nice to see you bill!"

"thanks guys. i drove here. i didn't want to risk this infection anymore so i decided to keep driving my car around. i don't mind the fossil fuel emission if i'm safe this way. it's funny because i live 10 feet from here, in fact were right near my house. this is a pandemic time you know."

*house is right next to the group, like a straight drive away.*

"my work as a legislator requires me to help keep efforts strong against the virus. so i kept all the good vibes gone and the same old happiness i had about life gone because i saw large amounts of people dying for the first time! it is as if life stopped being this great place full of kittens and joy i learned as a kid. now, i know more about how it really is and chose to enact stricter social distancing rules and i helped close down nearly all small businesses in name of keeping the upper class alive! we didn't have time to work out all the messy details of unemployment and other means to earn cash for those people. but, who cares?! they aren't us and i've got a **grand vacation planned in 2021!** we can't get in the way of that!"

"glad to see you are like me, bill. i don't care either, but hey we do the best we can."

> do you see? too much social distancing and listening to lawmakers without question makes one unreasonable and prone to authority bias. do you know what happens when all minor businesses close?

> people flock to the major ones and this contradicts social distancing, more and more people are going to be in close contact rather than apart and big businesses that were already well off will continue to profit. the small ones? they lose money and might close permanently if funds are not steady.

> in addition, what if politicians change their minds? what if they want some people exempt from their rules, like with online privacy without use of a vpn? and why are their salaries as fat as ever? economically speaking corona is a poor man's illness. and i'm keeping this truth. the lower class remembers this year, 2020, more strongly than those lawmakers, lawyers, judges, and other wealthy aristocrats who 'work' during this time. no lawmaker has to worry too much about heating, electricity, and water nor unemployment. sure, they say 'but i work hard! it's worth it, right!', but tell that to the equally hardworking janitors who aren't sitting on their butts like you, tell that to those poor single moms, tell that to those sleep deprived college students, tell that to those working 2 jobs right now to make ends meet. in this country, nearly all of us work hard, it's plain truth. so...suddenly making a house is easier than lawmaking? when did that become true when both show signs of exhaustion by the end of their shift? everyone has to work hard doing something, and all of it uses intelligence.

‚ùñ keep reasoning...question policy making during this time.
